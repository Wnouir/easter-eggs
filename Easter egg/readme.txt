We made a quick website to serve as the testing ground for our easter features,
the easters are:
- Sonic, mario, chinese panda, walter white and pepe.
each have a specific tooltip line that makes recognizing the reference easier, which is apparent on hover.

the other easter is a tetris mini game the link to the maker's github is in the code, as we would need 2 "nuit d'infos" if we were to code a mini game from scratch,
we simply prepared a window popup with a close button in the website with a background music for it.

How to trigger each easter:

- clicking on the element "click me" spawns at random, some of the images that we defined in the js query code, in random areas, at random, small sizes that can be configured.

- clicking on coin elemnt in the website 3 times triggers the mini game.
